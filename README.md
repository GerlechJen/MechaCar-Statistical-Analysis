# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview

In this project, statistical tests and analysis were performed using R. A company,  AutosRUs, wants to utilize data analytics in all their decision making as they believe that will make them have very successful automobile launches. 

As the primary analyst for the data analytics team of the company, I am responsible for  performing  retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specifications and study design of future product testing.
 
I have to ensure that analysis I perform contains a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric and clear interpretation of the results. Summary statistics will also be provided for different variables, visualizations for different datasets and interpretation of statistical test results. Also, using my critical thinking skills, I will propose my own study design,  hypotheses and analysis workflow that will make autosRUs manufacturing processes even better. 

In my first ever project I will be working on AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. It is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. My task here is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. I will be performing these specific tasks:
1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, I'll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
