# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview

In this project, statisticall tests and analysis were performed using R. A company,  AutosRUs, wants to utilize data analytics in all their decision making as they believe that will make them have very successful automobile launches. 

As the primary analyst for the data analytics team of the company, I am responsible for  performing  retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specifications and study design of future product testing.
 
I have to ensure that my analysis contains a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric and clear interpretation of the results. 

Summary statistics will also be provided for different variables, visualizations for different datasets and my interpretation of statistical test results .

And then using my critical thinking skills, I will propose my own study design,  hypotheses and analysis workflow that will make autosRUs manufacturing processes even better.
